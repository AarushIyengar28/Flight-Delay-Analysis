# Flight-Delay-Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes flight delay data to understand the underlying causes and patterns of delays. Using data from an airline delay dataset, this analysis identifies the frequency of delays, their causes, and the impact on flight schedules. The goal is to provide insights into which factors contribute most to delays, helping airlines and passengers make informed decisions.

Project Components
1. Data Import & Cleaning
The dataset is sourced from an Excel file and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
The data is cleaned by handling missing values, filtering out outliers, and ensuring data integrity.
2. SQLite Database Integration
The cleaned data is stored in an SQLite database to facilitate efficient querying and analysis.
The data is organized and queried using SQL commands to identify specific delay-related patterns.
3. Data Analysis
The analysis focuses on identifying flight delays caused by various factors, such as late aircraft arrivals, weather, or security delays.
Filtering of delays ensures that outlier values (extremely high delays) are excluded from the analysis to maintain accuracy.
4. Data Visualization
Visualizations, including histograms, are created using Matplotlib to represent the distribution of delays.
Insights are drawn from these visualizations to show the most frequent causes and the severity of delays.
Key Features
SQL Queries: Queries are executed on the dataset stored in an SQLite database to analyze and filter the delay data.
Data Visualization: Histograms of delays help visualize the data distribution.
Insights: The project generates actionable insights into the main causes of delays.
Technologies & Tools
Python: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Pandas: Used for data processing and cleaning.
SQLite: A lightweight database for storing and querying delay data.
Matplotlib: For visualizing delay data.
Excel: Data is sourced from an Excel spreadsheet.
How to Run the Project
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas sqlite3 matplotlib openpyxl
Update the filepath variable in the script to the location of your Excel file.
Run the main Python script:
bash
Copy code
python Flight_Delay_Data.py
Example Output
Distribution of Delays: The project generates a histogram visualizing the distribution of late aircraft delays.
SQL Queries: Queries output the filtered data for late aircraft delays (greater than 0 but less than 1000 minutes).
